                <p>Stepping onto a basketball court for the first time, the smell of wet asphalt dived deep into my
                    lungs. The bright colours painted on the floor momentarily blinded my eyes. This was deep in the
                    heart of Nairobi's Eastlands eleven years ago. High cylindrical hoops were the gateway to success. I
                    could not reach them then, but I was motivated to do so eventually. Growing up in the city, everyone
                    went about their business without minding what others were doing. At the time, the financial
                    situation in the country was tight. Everyone had to tighten their belt to survive. The economy did
                    not spare our family. Both my parents had to leave very early for work. Being left home on most
                    days, education and sports were my refuges. I schooled at Donholm Catholic Primary School, which is
                    minutes from home. Because of my parents' strict schedule, I used to arrive at school as early as
                    six. Even though it seemed difficult, I embraced the situation and took the time to get on top of my
                    studies. By the time I was in class five, I was among the best. Academic excellence is good.
                    However, it was clear that my goal was to be more than just a good student. Basketball was one of
                    the ways in which I was able to grow myself. Basketball was a mere sport at first, something I did
                    for fun. However, as I played and watched more games, it became much more than that.
                    Immediately after I joined the team at school, it was apparent that someone had to step up to become
                    the captain. I became that person. This was pivotal in my growth. Working with my peers while
                    leading them was an initially daunting task. But I learned to manoeuvre through it. From then on, I
                    gained courage in leadership and took up various leadership roles in primary school. Though I would
                    have never guessed it while I was starting, basketball
                    provided one of the central metaphors of my life. It taught me leadership and tenacity, which I
                    absorbed humbly and instinctively by making hard decisions that sometimes did not go well with my
                    teammates. However, my hard work in and out of the classroom bore fruit as I excelled in my KCPE
                    exam and gained admission to Mang'u High School.
                    Transitioning into high school was a whole different ball game. First, I was taken aback by the
                    diversity. The students represented every region and community in the country. We were members of an
                    orchestra in which each instrument was essential to the complementary and harmonious playing of the
                    whole. Not knowing anyone in school, I clung to what I knew best; basketball and academics. Then, I
                    discovered my passion for community service while in high school. Hailing from Nairobi's Eastlands,
                    I knew the people's challenges but needed a platform to help solve them. Joining Rotary club in high
                    school provided a platform to better the environment. Through the organization of planting and
                    cleaning programmes, I was able to
                    impact the environment, albeit on a small scale.
                    Growth was my primary motivation as
                    I wanted to better myself and those around me. The covid 19 pandemic was also a very pivotal moment.
                    Witnessing many people despair, families being broken and children being abandoned was
                    heart-wrenching. All this is due to financial hardship. The situation inspired me to find solutions
                    to some of the people's economic problems. Despite all this, I never let my grades slip as I knew it
                    was how I could make a difference in society. Playing basketball made me conscious that to complete
                    myself truly; I needed to incorporate those around me. As I move on to the next phase of my life, I
                    want to be impactful in society. Given a chance to study in the bootcamp, I hope to learn and come
                    up with
                    solutions to the issues back home. After
                    years of rigorous basketball training, I have come to appreciate the importance of unity and
                    self-awareness that it has instilled in me, and I'm determined to carry it on in future.</p>
